3. (Optional) Inside 'info', create a blank text document titled 'history.txt'
4. Run the .jar file to play <br />

## CONTROLS

* WASD - Movement <br />
* Fire Primary - Space Bar <br />

* Open Store - P <br />

## HOW TO PLAY

As of now, the goal of the game is to achieve as high a score as possible. <br />
<br />
Killing mobs with your weapons systems will grant money and add points to your score. If an enemy mob reaches the left side of the screen or crashes into your ship, you will lose lives or HP respectively. Once you run out of HP or lives, the game will end, save your score, and bring you to the game end screen. <br />
<br />
In the store menu you can buy ammunition, restore HP, or upgrade your weapons in exchange for money. <br />
<br />
If you want to mess around, you can turn on invincibility in the settings menu. (This will invalidate the legitimacy of your score) <br />

## FEATURES

* 10 unique mob types <br />
* 8 linear upgrade tiers for primary/secondary weapons <br />
