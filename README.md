HOW TO PLAY<br />
<br />
As of now, the goal of the game is to achieve as high a score as possible. Nevertheless, this is inherently a pointless objective since I haven't bothered to implement scorekeeping yet. <br />
<br />
If an enemy mob reaches the left side of the screen or crashes into your ship, you will lose loves or HP respectively. In the store menu, you can buy ammunition, restore HP, or upgrade your weaponsin exchange for money. Killing mobs grants money and points. <br />
<br />
If you just want to screw around, you can turn on invincibility in the settings menu. <br />
