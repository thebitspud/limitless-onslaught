**HOW TO PLAY**
<br />
As of now, the goal of the game is to achieve as high a score as possible. Nevertheless, this is inherently a pointless objective since I haven't bothered to implement scorekeeping yet. <br />
<br />
Killing mobs with your weapons systems will grant money and points. If an enemy mob reaches the left side of the screen or crashes into your ship, you will lose lives or HP respectively. Once you run out of HP or lives, the game will end and you will lose. <br />
<br />
In the store menu you can buy ammunition, restore HP, or upgrade your weapons in exchange for money. <br />
<br />
If you just want to screw around, you can turn on invincibility in the settings menu. (this invalidates the legitimacy of your score, but that doesn't matter because it doesn't get recorded anyways) <br />
