# limitless-onslaught
This is the first large project of mine that I have uploaded to GitHub. Hope you like it! :-) <br />

## INSTALLATION

1. Download Limitless Onslaught 80719.zip <br />
2. Extract the .zip file to your desired location <br />
<br />
That's pretty much it for now <br />

## CONTROLS

WASD - Movement <br />
Fire Primary - Space Bar <br />
Fire Secondary - M <br />
Open Store - P <br />
Pause Game - Esc <br />

## HOW TO PLAY

As of now, the goal of the game is to achieve as high a score as possible. <br />
<br />
Killing mobs with your weapons systems will grant money and add points to your score. If an enemy mob reaches the left side of the screen or crashes into your ship, you will lose lives or HP respectively. Once you run out of HP or lives, the game will end, save your score, and bring you to the game end screen. <br />
<br />
In the store menu you can buy ammunition, restore HP, or upgrade your weapons in exchange for money. <br />
<br />
If you want to mess around, you can turn on invincibility in the settings menu. (This will invalidate the legitimacy of your score) <br />

## FEATURES

10 unique mob types <br />
8 linear upgrade tiers for primary/secondary weapons <br />
7 unique weapon forms <br />
2 dynamic scrolling backgrounds (with looping) <br />
Endless arcade mode (also the only mode!) <br />
Easily accessible and modifiable scores <br />
Low-effort sound effects <br />
Heavily compressed royalty-free music <br />
Made in pure Java <br />
I don't know why my code works, but for some reason it does. <br />
